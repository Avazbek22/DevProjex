ShortDescription,Visual project context builder for humans and AI. Copy tree, code, or both — instantly.
Description,"Need to share project structure with a colleague? Preparing context for ChatGPT or Copilot? Explaining architecture in a code review?

DevProjex builds a clean, visual tree of any folder or repository. Select what matters with checkboxes, and copy it to clipboard — as an ASCII tree, file contents, or both combined.

What you get:

- Three copy modes — tree only, content only, or tree + content. Selection-aware or full export.
- Smart filtering — Built-in ignore rules for node_modules, build outputs, IDE configs. Customize as needed.
- Git support — Clone repos by URL, switch branches, fetch updates — all in a safe local cache.
- Search & filter — Find files fast in large codebases.
- 8 languages — English, Russian, Spanish, and more.

Built for trust:

- Read-only by design — DevProjex never modifies your files, never commits, never pushes.
- No telemetry, no cloud, no account required.
