# Privacy Policy — DevProjex

# 

# Last updated: 2026-02-10

# 

# DevProjex is a desktop application that helps users visualize folder/project structures, optionally read the contents of user-selected text files, and copy the results to the clipboard. The app is designed to be read-only with respect to user files.

# 

# 1\) Data We Collect

# DevProjex does not collect, store, or transmit personal data.

# DevProjex does not require an account and does not use analytics, tracking, advertising identifiers, or telemetry.

# 

# 2\) Files and Folder Access

# DevProjex accesses files and folders only when you explicitly select a folder/repository to open or clone.

# The app reads directory names and file names to build a tree view.

# If you choose a “copy content” action, the app reads the contents of the selected text files in order to place that text into your clipboard.

# DevProjex does not modify, delete, or upload your files.

# 

# 3\) Clipboard

# When you use copy features, DevProjex places the generated tree and/or selected text content into your system clipboard. Clipboard contents are controlled by your operating system and other apps may be able to read clipboard data according to OS rules.

# 

# 4\) Network and Git Features

# DevProjex may access the network only when you use Git-related features (for example, cloning a repository, fetching updates, or listing branches). These operations are read-only and are used solely to download repository data into a local cache on your device.

# DevProjex does not send your local files to any server and does not upload changes to remote repositories (no commit/push/merge).

# 

# 5\) Local Storage

# DevProjex stores application settings locally on your device (such as UI preferences, language, themes/effects, and ignore rules).

# If you use Git features, repository data may be temporarily cached locally. The cache is intended to be removable/cleaned by the app when you close it.

# 

# 6\) Third-Party Services

# DevProjex does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

# 

# 7\) Children’s Privacy

# DevProjex is not directed to children and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.

# 

# 8\) Changes to This Policy

# If DevProjex changes in a way that affects privacy, this policy will be updated. The “Last updated” date will reflect the latest revision.

#
