Need to share project context quickly?

What you get:

- Preview mode before copy/export
- Copy or export: Tree, Content, Tree + Content
- ASCII/JSON tree format toggle

- Live status bar metrics (lines, chars, ~tokens)
- Progress bar with operation cancel support
- 8 in-app languages

Built for trust:
