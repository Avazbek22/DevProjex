## 1) What it is and why
DevProjex quickly prepares project context: shows the folder/file structure, lets you select items with checkboxes, and copy the tree and/or file contents to the clipboard. Useful for code review, support, learning, and sharing project structure with an AI assistant.

Important: the app is read-only and never modifies files.

## 2) Project tree
* File/folder type icons.
* Checkboxes on nodes.
* Expand/collapse.

Checkboxes: selecting a node applies to its children; parent state is recalculated automatically.

Hotkeys:
* Ctrl+E — expand all
* Ctrl+W — collapse all (root stays expanded)

## 3) File
* Open folder… — open root folder (Ctrl+O)
* Refresh — rescan and rebuild the tree (F5)

## 4) Git
Git menu is available only for projects cloned via DevProjex (Git Clone). The app does not touch your files — it works only with the cache.

The cache is stored in the system temp folder. On Windows it is usually:
`%TEMP%\DevProjex\RepoCache`

* Branch — shows the list of remote branches; switching updates the tree to the selected branch. If the branch already exists locally, switching is offline (no update). If it does not exist locally, it is fetched and created.
* Get updates — updates only the current branch: fetch and reset to origin/<branch>.

## 5) Copy
### Copy full tree
Copies the full ASCII project tree. Ctrl+Shift+C.

### Copy selected tree
Copies the tree for selected (checked) nodes. If nothing is selected, a message is shown. Ctrl+Alt+C.

### Copy selected content
Copies contents of selected text files only:
* the file must exist;
* binary files are skipped (checked for null bytes);
* output is sorted and separated by blank lines.

Ctrl+Alt+V.

### Copy tree + content
Combines tree and content:
* tree is built from selection; if selection is invalid, full tree is used;
* content is added only for text files;
* if there is no content, only the tree is copied.

Ctrl+Shift+V.

## 6) View
### Zoom
* Ctrl++ / Ctrl+= — zoom in
* Ctrl+- — zoom out
* Ctrl+0 — reset
* Ctrl + mouse wheel over the tree — smooth zoom

Range: 6–28, reset is 12.

### Compact Mode
Makes the UI denser: smaller spacing in the tree and settings.

## 7) Search (tree)
Opens the search bar, highlights matches, and allows navigation.
* Ctrl+F — show/hide
* Enter — next result
* Shift+Enter — previous
* Esc — close

Search auto-expands only the needed branches; clearing the query collapses the tree (except root).

## 8) Filter (by name)
Shows only nodes matching the filter string and their parents. Updates are debounced.
* Ctrl+Shift+N — show/hide filter
* Esc — close filter

## 9) Options (settings panel)
Lists on the right:
* Font (tree font) — apply with Apply
* Ignore options
* Extensions
* Root folders

Each list has an All toggle.

Ctrl+P — show/hide the panel.

## 10) Ignore and Smart Ignore
### Regular rules
Exclude common artifacts and noise (e.g., bin/obj, hidden items, dot-items, etc.).

### Smart Ignore
Additional smart exclusions (e.g., VCS/IDE folders and typical junk files). Frontend rules activate only when related project markers are detected (package/lock files).

## 11) How the tree is built
Result depends on:
* selected Root folders
* selected Extensions
* Ignore rules
* active Filter

If access is denied, the node is marked Access denied.

## 12) Icons
Icon selection order:
1) node type (folder/file)
2) exact name (if rule exists)
3) extension
4) otherwise — unknown

## 13) Theme and effects
Theme popover lets you switch:
* light/dark theme
* Transparent / Mica / Acrylic
* intensity, blur, contrast, border settings

Items marked [Beta] may change between versions.

## 14) Help → About
Opens a popover with app info and repository link.
* Esc — close popover

## 15) Languages
Language is selected via the Language menu.

## 16) Notes
* By default, dark theme and transparency effects are enabled (if supported).
* If permissions are insufficient, the app may suggest restarting with elevation; if declined, a notification is shown.
