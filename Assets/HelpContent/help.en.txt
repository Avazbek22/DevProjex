## 1) What it is and why
DevProjex quickly prepares project context: shows the folder/file structure, lets you select items with checkboxes, and copy the tree and/or file contents to the clipboard. Useful for code review, support, learning, and sharing project structure with an AI assistant.

Important: the app is read-only and never modifies files.

## 2) Project tree
* File/folder type icons.
* Checkboxes on nodes.
* Expand/collapse.

Checkboxes: selecting a node applies to its children; parent state is recalculated automatically.

Hotkeys:
* Ctrl+E — expand all
* Ctrl+W — collapse all (root stays expanded)

## 3) File
* Open folder… — open root folder (Ctrl+O)
* Refresh — rescan and rebuild the tree (F5)
* Export to file:
  * Export tree
  * Export content
  * Export tree and content

Format rules:
* Export tree:
  * ASCII -> `.txt` only.
  * JSON -> default `.json`, with both `.json` and `.txt` available in Save dialog.
* Export content — always text content format, `.txt` file (ASCII/JSON toggle does not apply).
* Export tree and content — always `.txt` file; the ASCII/JSON toggle affects only the tree block format inside the result.

Export files are written in UTF-8 without BOM.

### Drag & Drop
Drag and drop works in the startup area (Drop Zone) when no project is loaded.

Rules:
* you can drop a folder;
* you can drop a file — in this case the containing folder is opened;
* if multiple items are dropped, the first suitable local path is used;
* if a path is unavailable or does not exist, the same access checks as in “Open folder…” are applied;
* unsupported or non-local items are ignored.

## 4) Git
Git menu is available only for projects cloned via DevProjex (Git Clone). The app does not touch your files — it works only with the cache.

The cache is stored in the system temp folder. On Windows it is usually:
`%TEMP%\DevProjex\RepoCache`

* Branch — shows the list of remote branches; switching updates the tree to the selected branch. If the branch already exists locally, switching is offline (no update). If it does not exist locally, it is fetched and created.
* Get updates — updates only the current branch: fetch and reset to origin/<branch>.

## 5) Copy
### Tree format toggle (ASCII/JSON)
The toggle defines the tree representation format for operations where the tree is part of the output.

* ASCII — text tree with branches.
* JSON — structured tree in JSON.

The toggle affects:
* Copy tree
* Copy tree + content
* Export tree
* Export tree and content

The toggle does not affect:
* Copy content
* Export content

### Copy tree
Copies the project tree.
If there are checked nodes, the tree is built from selection; if the selection is empty or invalid, the full tree is copied.
The result format is defined by the ASCII/JSON toggle.
Hotkeys: Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Alt+C.

### Copy content
Copies file contents:
* if files are checked — only those; otherwise — all project files;
* non-text files are ignored (including binary);
* for empty text files, the path and the line `[No Content, 0 bytes]` are output;
* for files containing only whitespace/line breaks, the path and the line `[Whitespace, N bytes]` are output.
Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+V.

### Copy tree + content
Combines tree and content:
* tree is built from selection; if selection is empty/invalid, the full tree is used;
* content follows the same rules as “Copy content”;
* tree block format is defined by the ASCII/JSON toggle.
Hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+V.

### JSON representation
JSON mode uses a compact tree structure.

Tree (Copy tree / Export tree):
* `rootPath` — absolute root path.
* `root` — root node.
* node fields: `name`, `path`, `dirs`, `files`, `accessDenied` (when needed).

Tree + content:
* JSON applies to the tree block;
* content block remains text;
* exported as `.txt`.

## 6) Preview mode
Opened with the eye icon button in the top bar or with Ctrl+B.

Shows the final result in read-only mode, without copying to clipboard and without exporting to file.

Available modes:
* Tree
* Content
* Tree and content

The same rules as copy and export are applied:
* checked nodes are respected;
* if selection is empty, the full data set is used;
* current ignore rules and selection options are applied.

When preview is open, search and filter are unavailable.
In settings, only font change is available.
Close: X button or click the eye icon again.

## 7) View
### Zoom
* Ctrl++ / Ctrl+= — zoom in
* Ctrl+- — zoom out
* Ctrl+0 — reset
* Ctrl + mouse wheel over the tree — smooth zoom

Range: 6–28, reset is 12.

### Compact Mode
Makes the UI denser: smaller spacing in the tree and settings.

### Tree animation
Enables smooth slide animation when hovering over tree rows.

## 8) Search (tree)
Opens the search bar, highlights matches, and allows navigation.
* Ctrl+F — show/hide
* Enter — next result
* Shift+Enter — previous
* Esc — close

Search auto-expands only the needed branches; clearing the query collapses the tree (except root).

## 9) Filter (by name)
Shows only nodes matching the filter string and their parents. Updates are debounced.
* Ctrl+Shift+N — show/hide filter
* Esc — close filter

## 10) Options (settings panel)
Lists on the right:
* Font (tree font) — apply with Apply
* Ignore options
* Extensions
* Root folders

Each list has an All toggle.

Note about "Extensions":
* this list shows only files that have an extension;
* files without an extension are not added to this list and are controlled by a separate option in "Ignore".

Ctrl+P — show/hide the panel.

## 11) Ignore
The "Ignore" list is built automatically from the current path and selected top-level folders.

Option order:
* Smart ignore (when available)
* Use .gitignore (when at least one `.gitignore` is found)
* Hidden folders
* Hidden files
* Dot-prefixed folders
* Dot-prefixed files
* Files without extension (shown only when such files are detected)

The separator under "Use .gitignore" splits Git/Smart rules from basic visibility rules.

### 11.1 Rule scope
The app builds project scopes where ignore rules are applied:
* root (if root has `.gitignore` or a project marker)
* first-level folders
* nested project subfolders

Nested project scope discovery depth is fixed: 2 levels.

### 11.2 "Use .gitignore"
* Enabled: `.gitignore` rules are applied in detected scopes.
* Disabled: `.gitignore` rules are fully disabled.

For multi-project folders, one project's `.gitignore` is not applied to neighboring projects outside its scope.

### 11.3 "Smart ignore"
* Shown only when it is relevant.
* Enabled: common build/tool artifacts are additionally hidden.
* Disabled: smart rules are not applied.

### 11.4 Basic rules
Options:
* Hidden folders
* Hidden files
* Dot-prefixed folders
* Dot-prefixed files

These rules are independent from `.gitignore` and Smart Ignore and work only by their own toggles.

### 11.5 Internal behavior: common cases
1. Single project with `.gitignore`.
Usually only "Use .gitignore" is shown.
When enabled, `.gitignore` and Smart Ignore work together.
When disabled, both `.gitignore` and Smart Ignore are disabled.

2. Single project without `.gitignore`.
"Use .gitignore" is not shown.
"Smart ignore" is shown only when relevant.

3. Multi-project workspace, some projects have `.gitignore`, some do not.
Both "Use .gitignore" and "Smart ignore" are shown.
`.gitignore` works inside its own scopes.
Smart Ignore (when enabled) complements filtering in detected scopes.

4. Multi-project workspace, all projects have `.gitignore`.
"Use .gitignore" is shown.
"Smart ignore" is not shown as a separate option.

5. Folder without relevant rules.
If no `.gitignore` is found and Smart Ignore is not relevant, these options are hidden.
Only basic visibility rules remain.

### 11.6 Files without extension
The "Files without extension" option controls visibility of files without an extension (for example: `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `README`).

Rules:
* this option is shown only when such files are actually present in the current data set;
* when enabled, files without extension are excluded from the tree and from copy/export operations;
* when disabled, files without extension are included in the result;
* the "Extensions" list does not control this behavior.
## 12) How the tree and metrics are calculated
Result depends on:
* selected Root folders
* selected Extensions
* Ignore rules
* active Filter
* checked tree nodes (for selection-based operations)

If access is denied, the node is marked Access denied.

### 12.1 What status bar counters show
The status bar has two blocks:
* Tree — metrics of the tree text output;
* Content — metrics of exported file content output.

Format:
* Lines
* Chars
* ~Tokens (approximate)

Large values are shown with compact suffixes (K/M).

Important:
* "Lines" in the "Tree" block means the number of lines in the final tree representation, not the number of files on disk;
* this value includes folders, files, and tree service elements (for example, access-denied nodes).

### 12.2 How metrics are calculated
Tree metrics:
* are calculated from the actual tree output generated by the same export pipeline;
* respect the current ASCII/JSON format.

Content metrics:
* follow the same rules as content copy/export;
* binary files are excluded;
* empty and whitespace-only files are counted via service markers (`[No Content, 0 bytes]`, `[Whitespace, N bytes]`).

### 12.3 When counters update
Recalculation runs:
* after opening/refreshing a project;
* after applying settings (ignore, extensions, root folders);
* when tree checkboxes change (with debounce);
* when switching ASCII/JSON (for operations where tree output is used).
* when background calculation is canceled, counters are set to 0 until the next completed recalculation.

## 13) Icons
Icon selection order:
1) node type (folder/file)
2) exact name (if rule exists)
3) extension
4) otherwise — unknown

## 14) Theme and effects
Theme popover lets you switch:
* light/dark theme
* Transparent / Mica / Acrylic
* intensity, blur, contrast, border settings

Items marked [Beta] may change between versions.

## 15) Help → About
Opens a popover with app info and repository link.
Reset settings (Help → Reset settings) resets only visual interface settings (theme, effects, Compact Mode, Tree animation) and does not modify project data.
* Esc — close popover

## 16) Languages
Language is selected via the Language menu.

## 17) Progress bar and cancel
The center of the status bar shows the active operation and its progress.

Progress modes:
* Indeterminate — no percent (operation duration is unknown).
* Determinate — with percent (0–100).

Behavior:
* during background data calculation, percent progress is shown;
* for some Git operations, percent is shown when the progress source provides it;
* for very fast operations, progress can appear only briefly.

X button (cancel) in the status bar:
* performs best-effort cancellation for operations that support cancellation;
* stops background data calculation;
* for operations without cancellation support, it stops status-bar indication, while the operation itself may still finish in background.

## 18) Notes
* By default, dark theme and transparency effects are enabled (if supported).
* If permissions are insufficient, the app may suggest restarting with elevation; if declined, a notification is shown.
